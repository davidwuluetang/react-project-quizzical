# Project Description

This is an [online quiz website](https://react-project-quizzical.vercel.app/) created by me as practice using React. This website will pull 5 random computer science question from [Open Trivia Database API](https://opentdb.com/api_config.php) for user to answer. The project is introduced by Scrimba React course. Project guidelines can be found on this [link](https://v2.scrimba.com/learn-react-c0e/~05i).
